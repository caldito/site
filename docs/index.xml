      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Pablo GÃ³mez-Caldito, I love building tools, products and infrastructure using software. My work experience is mainly in SRE, increasing the reliability of online services and implementing the DevOps philosophy in organizations. I also release Open-Source Software projects and have fun learning about Information Security.
Currently working as Senior DevOps Engineer at Streamsets and previously at idealista. You can check my resume to learn more.
