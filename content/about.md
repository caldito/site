---

I'm Pablo GÃ³mez-Caldito, I love building tools, products and infrastructure using software. My work experience is mainly in SRE/Platform Engineering, increasing the reliability of online services and implementing the DevOps philosophy in organizations. I also release OSS projects, practice self-hosting in my homelab and have fun learning about Information Security.

You can check my <a href="/docs/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> to learn more about my experience.
