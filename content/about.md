I'm Pablo GÃ³mez-Caldito, I love building tools, products and infrastructure using software. My work experience is mainly in SRE, increasing the reliability of online services and implementing the DevOps philosophy in organizations. I also release Open-Source Software projects and have fun learning about Information Security.

Currently working as Senior DevOps Engineer at <a href="https://streamsets.com" target="_blank">Streamsets</a> and previously at <a href="https://idealista.com" target="_blank">idealista</a>. You can check my <a href="/docs/resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a> to learn more.
