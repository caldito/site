The main goal of someone working in the technology space (or any knowledge worker to be fair) is value creation. Either to their organization you are in or to the market.

In my opinion the process of value creation has the following stages:
- **Education**
    
    In order to do anything you need knowledge or basic skills
- **Generate new knowledge**

    Process our current knowledge to get new one. I also consider identifying problems in the world or company as new knowledge. 
- **Extract value out of the knowledge** 
    
    There are two ways of doing it, which often can (and should) be combined:
    - With hard skills we solve problems
    - With soft skills we leverage people

    Combining both will reach the biggest impact. Only sharing new knowledge is teaching and solutions that don't get consensus of other people don't get very far or are solutions to small problems. But when you fix problems and get others to be excited about your solution and help it materialize you will be a force multiplyer. The biggest the problems and the people helping materialize your vision the better.


There are many ways to approach the steps above and skills which are useful.


However there are a few which are fundamental to each phase of the process and have been going on for millenials and are what have propelled our civillization forward. Thus I think these skills are core to the value generation process:
- **Reading:** What you consume is food for your thinking. You need to consume enough quantity of good quality knowledge.
- **Thinking:** Analyze problems and provide solutions on them. Sintetize existing information and/or new usefull knowledge
- **Writing:** Generates value to others from our solutions to problems and new knowledge
